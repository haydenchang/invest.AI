****Invest.AI****

Rag-Powered Fiancial Analysis System Using Real Earnings Reports

**Overview**
Invest.AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform that evaluates whether a stock is undervalued, fairly priced, or overvalued based on the investing style the user selects.

The system ingests 10-K/10-Q filings, earnigns call transcripts, investor letters, and fiancial ratios, then generates an AI-driven valuation consistent with the logic used by major investors (Buffett style value investing, growth investing, quant factor models, etc)

This project uses a full production grade stack, including a typed frontend, a scalable backend, and a high-performance RAG pipeline backed by vector search and LLMS.
